# Call for Talk Proposals

\[Something\]Con is a new conference about creative and unusual applications of computing. If you're building an art project, esoteric language, custom input device, or something we can't possibly predict, we're building a community of people who want to hear about it\!

This is our first year as a conference, so you have the chance to set the standard for the unexpected topics we can all learn about here.

Your talk should:

- Be about something computing related  
- Be about something you think is worth sharing and discussing

There's no pressure for your subject to have any kind of academic or commercial significance (though they might) \- the goal is to bring us together in discussing the weird and wondrous corners of technology that don’t always get hype elsewhere.

If that sounds like something you want to make happen, submit a talk here: \<link to form\>

All talks will be TBD minutes long. Your submission should include:

- Title \- a short phrase to get reviewers, and later attendees, interested in your talk. Head-turning hooks welcome\!  
- Description \- a one-paragraph description to expand on the core subject of the talk. Answer any necessary questions raised by your title and tell us what we can expect to learn from the talk.  
- Reviewer Info \- additional information used by reviewers to evaluate your talk. Give us a few of the main points you plan to make about your topic and a little bit about the background you bring to it. We don’t need a full script; just enough detail to understand what you’re planning.

Important dates:

- Now: Call for talk proposals opens.  
- TBD: Proposal submissions due.  
- TBD: Notifications sent for talk acceptance.  
- TBD: Deadline for speakers to confirm participation.  
- TBD: Conference\!

Submissions will be reviewed by members of our organizing team.

# Code of Conduct

Below, you'll find the Code of Conduct for SomethingCon events, which borrows heavily from [the Exclamation Foundation Code of Conduct](https://bangbangcon.com/conduct.html). We are not associated with the Exclamation Foundation in any way, but the founding organizers met at [!!Con 2024](https://bangbangcon.com/index.html) and were inspired by the amazing community that EF created there. ❤️

## How to SomethingCon

These three behaviors are at the very core of SomethingCon culture:

* Be kind and thoughtful.
* Understand and respect others.
* Mind boundaries.

If you center on these, you're definitely SomethingConning. We will spell them out more below very soon.
